# C# Fundamentals

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/language_intros/challenges/csharp/README.ed.md)_

C# is a very popular language in the software world. It can be used to build a lot of different kind of programs, including desktop, web applications and games. If you've previously learned a language like Ruby or Javascript, C# is going to feel really different in a number of interesting ways! :)

In this module, you'll first work through some introductory bites, each of 
which focuses on one thing, then you'll be challenged to bring everything 
together in an extended programming exercise.

## Learning objectives

* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
* Explain the main differences between C# and a language like Python.
* Test-drive a simple C# program.

Very few people will complete all of the materials (and that's fine) but if 
you have any concerns, please reach out to your coach ASAP.

## Install .NET

.NET (sometimes called `dotnet`) is a platform for building applications in C#. It helps you to do a _ton_ of stuff so I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here - you'll learn about what it can do through using it (starting simple, of course). The first step is to install it.

```sh
; brew install dotnet-sdk
```

Once this is done, you should be able to check the installed .Net version by typing `dotnet --version` in the terminal. Example:

```sh
; dotnet --version
```

## IDE SetUp

The following VSCode extensions are going to be very useful, so install them now.

* [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
* ['C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)'](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).
* [.NET Core Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer).

> You might need to reload or restart VS code after installing those

## Phase 1 - C# syntax, NUnit and ASP.NET

You'll probably find that you complete the first few bites quickly whilst the last few will take a bit longer. Don't feel that you need to memorise everything before moving on - you can always come back here for a recap. You'll also find that several concepts come up repeatedly as you progress, so there will be opportunities to get further practice.

Some of these challenges include Process Feedback Challenges, in which you share
resources like recordings or files with your coach(es) for feedback. These are
tagged with a :satellite:.

## Phase 2 - Bank

Use the [Bank Challenge](./bank.md) to consolidate and extend your C# skills.

## Extension Challenges

If you complete all of the above, please reflect on what you'd like to get more practice with and reach out to your coach with that specific request. They'll be able to guide you in the right direction.
